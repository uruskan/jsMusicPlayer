# Music Player

Project Description:

This JavaScript music player project was created as part of my learning journey, following the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. The player allows users to listen to music tracks, navigate through playlists, and control playback functionalities. It was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it incorporates modern web development techniques and best practices. Feel free to explore the codebase, contribute, or use it as a learning resource.
